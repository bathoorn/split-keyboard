# Case / PCB co-design workflow

The case and the boards constrain each other, so neither can simply be
"designed first". This is how the two proceed without deadlocking or
silently drifting apart.

---

## 1. It is not one loop — it is three couplings, and only one is circular

| Coupling | Direction | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Layout → main PCB outline, **and** layout → plate/case outline | **one-way, layout wins** | Key positions are frozen (PLAN.md §0). The main PCB edge and the case plate are both offsets of the *same* polygon. Neither can push back on the other. |
| Knob mechanism → knob PCB **and** → pod cavity | **one-way, mechanism wins** | Bearing, ring and sensor stack are physical facts discovered in Phase 2. Board and cavity are both consequences of them. |
| Controller PCB ↔ case cavity | **genuinely two-way** | The only real loop in the project. |

Two of the three apparent circular dependencies dissolve once you notice the
arrows point the same way. Resolve those by *ordering*, and spend the real
effort on the one loop that remains.

---

## 2. The rule: push the uncertainty into the part with the most slack

- **Main PCBs: zero slack.** Key positions fix the outline completely.
- **Knob modules: little slack.** The mechanism fixes them.
- **Controller: enormous slack.** Small, singular, nearly any rectangle will
  do, and ~$15 to respin.

So the controller absorbs the coupling. **Fix its envelope by decree, early
and generously, and design inward.** Do not let the case negotiate with it.

Current envelope: **50 × 35 mm, ≤ 10 mm above the PCB** (`interface.yaml`).
The case guarantees that volume; the controller fits inside it. Neither side
may reshape it without a version bump and a re-fit.

---

## 3. The controller paradox

Phase 4.5 orders the controller **first**, to de-risk the MCU. But its
outline depends on a case that does not exist yet. This is the user's
question in its sharpest form, so it deserves a direct answer.

**The circuit and the outline are separate problems.** The circuit must be
validated early. The outline only has to be *good enough*. Fix a generous
envelope, build the circuit inside it, order it, and accept that the first
controller may be mechanically suboptimal. If the finished case wants a
different shape, respin it — it is the cheapest board in the project, and by
then the circuit is proven.

**Never invert this.** Waiting for a finished case before validating the MCU
trades a $15 risk for a six-week one.

---

## 4. Single source of truth: `hardware/interface.yaml`

Both sides read it. Neither side owns it. It carries only what crosses the
electrical/mechanical boundary — board outlines, datums, pod centres, the
controller envelope, the z-stack, port positions, mounting holes, and the
one measured `fit_clearance`.

Anything living wholly inside one domain — trace widths, fillet radii — does
not belong in it.

---

## 5. Exchange formats

| Direction | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CAD → KiCad | **DXF** of board outline + mounting hole positions → `Edge.Cuts` | KiCad cannot usefully consume STEP as a *constraint*, only as decoration. |
| KiCad → CAD | **STEP** of the populated board → imported read-only | This is the fit reference, and the only honest one, because it carries real component heights. |

**Never redraw an outline by hand in the other tool.** Every instance of
"I'll just trace it roughly" is a future interference you find after paying
for PCBs.

---

## 6. Gates

Each gate is a freeze. Work downstream of a gate assumes everything upstream
of it is stable.

| Gate | Frozen | Entry criteria | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G0** | Key layout | Phase 0 paper mockup passed with your hands on it | Main PCB outlines, plate outline |
| **G1** | Knob mechanism | Phase 2 prototype: a ring you like turning, dimensioned | Knob PCB, pod cavity, knob z-stack |
| **G2** | `interface.yaml` v1 | No `TODO` left in the file | Detailed case CAD, controller layout |
| **G3** | Board outlines | Edge.Cuts final on all four designs | Case interior detailing against real geometry |
| **G4** | Virtual fit | STEP assembly of all boards in the case shows no interference | Ordering PCBs |
| **G5** | Physical fit | Printed coupons pass (§8) | Ordering everything else |

G0 is passed. G1 is Phase 2. **G2 is the real milestone** — the `TODO`s in
`interface.yaml` are the exact list of what still blocks it.

---

## 7. Change control after G2

Any change to `interface.yaml`:

1. Bump `version`, add a `changelog` line saying what and why.
2. Re-run the virtual fit (G4).
3. Re-print only the affected coupon.

This costs minutes. Skipping it is precisely how a case and a PCB drift into
a $200 mismatch nobody notices until assembly.

---

## 8. Print coupons, not cases

A full case print is hours; a coupon is 15–30 minutes. Never validate a
detail by printing the whole thing.

| Coupon | Tests |
|---|---|
| **Pod** | Bearing seat, ring clearance and feel, sensor pocket depth, Cirque metal keep-out |
| **Port** | USB-C and TRRS wall cutouts against real connectors |
| **Switch** | 2×2 plate section: switch retention, hotswap clearance below PCB, one standoff |
| **FFC** | Connector clearance and whether the service loop can actually be assembled by human hands |

The FFC coupon is the one people skip and regret. A cable that fits in CAD
but cannot be seated with fingers is still a failure.

---

## 9. Tolerance calibration

Print **one** test strip of clearances (0.10–0.50 mm in 0.05 steps), measure
what your printer and filament actually produce, and record the result as the
single `fit_clearance` value in `interface.yaml`. Reference that value
everywhere.

Scattering hand-tuned clearances through the CAD makes the model
unre-printable on a different printer, or after a filament change.

---

## 10. Z is the axis that gets forgotten

X and Y are visible in every drawing you look at. Z is not, and it is where
the interferences hide. `interface.yaml` tracks the whole stack explicitly:

```
case floor
  └─ standoff                      TODO
      └─ below-PCB clearance       2.5   (hotswap socket ~1.8 + diode + margin)
          └─ main PCB              1.6
              └─ plate gap         5.0   (plate top to PCB top, standard MX)
                  └─ plate         1.5
```

The knob stack is **separate and taller** — ring, bearing and sensor — and is
what actually sets the case height. It stays `TODO` until Phase 2 produces
physical parts, which is why G1 gates the case detailing.
